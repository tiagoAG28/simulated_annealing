## Knapsack Problem with Simulated Annealing

This project implements a simulated annealing algorithm to solve the knapsack problem in Python. The code generates a random dataset of items—each with a random utility and weight—and then searches for the best combination of items that maximizes the total utility without exceeding the knapsack's maximum capacity.

### Features

- Dataset Generation: Randomly creates item utilities and weights.
- Objective Function: Calculates the total utility of a solution and penalizes solutions that exceed the knapsack capacity.
- Simulated Annealing Algorithm: Uses both exponential and linear cooling methods to explore the solution space.
- User Interaction: Prompts for input parameters via the command line (e.g., number of items, maximum utility, maximum weight, knapsack capacity, initial temperature, cooling rate, iterations, and cooling method).
- Visualization: Generates plots to show the evolution of temperature and the best objective value over iterations.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

### Installation

Ensure you have Python 3 installed, then install the required packages using pip:

`pip install numpy matplotlib `

### Usage

Run the script from the command line:

`python knapsack_sa.py`

You will be prompted to enter the following parameters:

- Number of Items: (e.g., 100)
- Maximum Utility per Item: (e.g., 100)
- Maximum Weight per Item: (e.g., 100)
- Knapsack Maximum Capacity: (e.g., 2500)
- Initial Temperature (T0): (e.g., 1000)
- Cooling Rate (alpha): (e.g., 0.995)
- Number of Iterations: (e.g., 1000)
- Cooling Method: ("exponential" or "linear")
- Random Seed (optional): For reproducibility

After inputting the parameters, the program will run the simulated annealing algorithm and output:

- The best objective value found.
- The total weight of the best solution.
- Plots showing the evolution of temperature and the best objective value over the iterations.

### Code Structure

- `create_knapsack_dataset`:
  Generates random utilities and weights for the specified number of items.

- `objective_function`:
  Computes the total utility of a given binary solution. If the total weight exceeds the knapsack capacity, it returns 0 to penalize the solution.

- `simulated_annealing`
  Implements the simulated annealing algorithm. It:

      - Initializes the current and best solutions.
      - Iteratively generates neighbor solutions and computes their change in objective value.
      - Decides whether to accept the neighbor based on the Metropolis criterion.
      - Updates the temperature according to the selected cooling method.
      - Records values for plotting and finally returns the best solution, its objective value, and a figure containing the plots.

- `main`:
  Manages user input, calls the above functions, and displays the results and plots.

### Example Output

When you run the script, you might see output similar to:
